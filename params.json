R needs to be installed with the **SDI** display option (you are prompted for using either SDI or MDI during the installation of R. Select the customized option to install). And you also need to tell R to write its registry entries during installation (you are prompted for that too).\r\n\r\nThen start R and type the following commands at the R prompt (you can cut and paste):\r\n>`options(install.packages.check.source = \"no\")`<br>\r\n>`install.packages(c(\"rscproxy\",\"rcom\"),repos=\"http://rcom.univie.ac.at/download\",lib=.Library,type=\"win.binary\")`<br>\r\n>`library(rcom)`<br>\r\n>`comRegisterRegistry()`<br>\r\n>`installstatconnDCOM()`\r\n\r\nThis will install **statconnDCOM** and set the R environment for **Inferno**.\r\n\r\nThen download the **Inferno executable** (see the top-left of this page for the zip file) and install it.\r\n***\r\n\r\nAmong many features of **Inferno** are:\r\n* A set of diagnostic plots (Histograms, boxplots, correlation plots, qq-plots, peptide-protein rollup plots, MA plots, PCA plots, etc).\r\n* Log transforming.\r\n* Rolling up to proteins (3 methods are available).\r\n* LOESS normalization\r\n* Linear Regression Normalization\r\n* Mean Centering\r\n* Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) Adjustment across datasets\r\n* Quantile Normalization\r\n* Principal Component Analysis\r\n* Partial Least Squares Analysis\r\n* ANOVA (multi-way, unbalanced, random effects)\r\n* Heatmaps with Hierarchical and K-means cluster options\r\n\r\nDependencies:\r\n\r\n**Inferno** depends on the following:\r\n1. MS Windows OS with .NET 2.0 framework \r\n2. R Statistical Environment (http://www.r-project.org/)\r\n3. statconnDCOM server (http://rcom.univie.ac.at)\r\n\r\nInferno uses the following R packages (from http://cran.r-project.org/):\r\n* amap: Another Multidimensional Analysis Package\r\n* car: Companion to Applied Regression\r\n* nlme: Linear and Nonlinear Mixed Effects Models\r\n* outliers: Tests for outliers\r\n* fpc: Fixed point clusters, clusterwise regression and discriminant plots\r\n* pls: Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) and Principal Component Regression (PCR)\r\n* MASS: Main Package of Venables and Ripley's MASS\r\n* impute: Imputation for microarray data\r\n* qvalue: Q-value estimation for false discovery rate control\r\n* e1071: Misc Functions of the Department of Statistics (e1071), TU Wien\r\n* gplots: Various R programming tools for plotting data\r\n* ellipse: Functions for drawing ellipses and ellipse-like confidence regions\r\n* plotrix: Various plotting functions\r\n* scatterplot3d: 3D Scatter Plot\r\n* colorspace: Colorspace Manipulation\r\n\r\n***\r\nDeveloped by Ashoka Polpitiya (ashoka.pol @ gmail.com)\r\n***\r\nLicense Agreement\r\n\r\n**Inferno** is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0; you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
